# Tech-Intern-Assessment

In this project, I developed a complete end-to-end solution for simulating, storing, analyzing, and visualizing call data. The process began with a Python script that generates realistic call records, capturing information such as the caller and callee details, timestamps, call durations, and call status. These records were stored in MongoDB, which acted as the central data repository.
After populating the database, I exported the collection to a CSV file (calls.csv). This file served as the primary input for analysis and visualization in Tableau.
Using Tableau Desktop, I designed five analytical sheetsâ€”each focused on a specific aspect of the dataset. The first sheet, "Calls by Type," presents a bar chart showing the distribution of different call categories. The second, "Calls by Status," visualizes call outcomes, such as completed, failed, and missed calls. The "Daily Calls" sheet uses a line chart to highlight day-to-day call volumes. "Calls by Weekday" compares activity across the week to identify peak days. Finally, the "Duration Histogram" illustrates how long calls typically last, using a frequency distribution.
To tie everything together, I built a consolidated dashboard that allows interactive filtering and provides a comprehensive overview of call behavior and performance trends.
To use the dashboard, the process is straightforward: run the Python script to populate MongoDB with synthetic data, export the data to a CSV file, and connect Tableau to the CSV. Users can then explore each individual sheet or interact directly with the combined dashboard to uncover insights.
